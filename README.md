# Pickle-Android-App
You're in a pickle. You've got to make a decision but you like both options equally. What do you do? 

Pickle it, and let your friends help you decide.

Simply snap two pictures (or choose them off your phone or the internet) and ask a question. Your friends will vote on your Pickle and let you know what they think you should choose! Everyone gets to see the posts and who voted for what, as well as a percentage breakdown of your Pickle. 

Or maybe you're just bored? Browse through your news feed and vote on your friend's Pickles, they will surely apreciate the help!

As friends, its everyone's duty to help each other out in their times of need.

If you're in a pickle, Pickle it! Theres no decision too tough to make when you have your friends rallying behind you. Let Social Voting do the work for you!
